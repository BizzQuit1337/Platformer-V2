This is the second attemp at a platformer.

Using the first attempt as a base and building from there to make a more interactive game.

The level maker file takes a background image. then the first click sets the first cordiantes and the second click sets the second cordinates
and saves them in the correct form in a empty text document. Those text documents are then read and used to make the level designs.
